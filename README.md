# Building a Complete GitOps Pipeline: Infrastructure and Application Deployment Automation

## Introduction

In this article, I'll walk you through implementing a complete GitOps pipeline that handles both infrastructure provisioning and application deployment. We'll use a combination of Terraform, Ansible, and Docker to create a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that follows best practices and maintains clear separation of concerns.

## Architecture Overview

[Insert the SVG diagram we created above]

Our pipeline is divided into two main components:

### 1. Infrastructure Pipeline
- Source Branch: `infra_features`
- Target Branch: `infra_main`
- Workflows: 
  - terraform-validate.yml
  - terraform-plan.yml
  - terraform-apply.yml
  - ansible-monitoring.yml

### 2. Application Pipeline
- Source Branch: `integration`
- Target Branch: `deployment`
- Workflows:
  - ci-application.yml
  - cd-application.yml

## Infrastructure Pipeline Deep Dive

### terraform-validate.yml
This workflow runs on every push to the `infra_features` branch:

```yaml
name: Terraform Validate
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} triggered Terraform validation

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - infra_features
    path:
      - 'terraform/**'
